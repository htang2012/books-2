      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">A brilliantly reported true-life thriller that goes behind
    the scenes of the financial crisis on Wall Street and in
    Washington. In one of the most gripping financial narratives in
    decades, Andrew Ross Sorkin-a New York Times columnist and one
    of the country's most respected financial reporters-delivers
    the first definitive blow- by-blow account of the epochal
    economic crisis that brought the world to the brink. Through
    unprecedented access to the players involved, he re-creates all
    the drama and turmoil of these turbulent days, revealing
    never-before-disclosed details and recounting how, motivated as
    often by ego and greed as by fear and self-preservation, the
    most powerful men and women in finance and politics decided the
    fate of the world's economy.</p>
