      <h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em>
        follows Joshua Foer's
      compelling journey as a participant in the U.S. Memory
      Championship. As a science journalist covering the
      competition, Foer became captivated by the secrets of the
      competitors, like how the current world memory champion, Ben
      Pridmore, could memorize the exact order of 1,528 digits in
      an hour. He met with individuals whose memories are truly
      unique—from one man whose memory only extends back to
      his most recent thought, to another who can memorize complex
      mathematical formulas without knowing any math. Brains
      remember visual imagery but have a harder time with other
      information, like lists, and so with the help of experts,
      Foer learned how to transform the kinds of memories he forgot
      into the kind his brain remembered naturally. The techniques
      he mastered made it easier to remember information, and
      Foer's story demonstrates that the tricks of the masters are
      accessible to anyone.

        <strong>Author Q&amp;A with Joshua Foer</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong>
        First, can you explain the title of you
      book,
        <em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em>
        ?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong>
        The title refers to a memory device I
      used in the US Memory Championship—specifically it's a
      mnemonic that helped me memorize a deck of playing cards.
      Moonwalking with Einstein works as a mnemonic because it's
      such a goofy image. Things that are weird or colorful are the
      most memorable. If you try to picture Albert Einstein sliding
      backwards across a dance floor wearing penny loafers and a
      diamond glove, that's pretty much unforgettable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong>
        What are the U.S. Memory Championships?
      How did you become involved?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong>
        The U.S. Memory Championship is a rather
      bizarre contest held each spring in New York City, in which
      people get together to see who can remember the most names of
      strangers, the most lines of poetry, the most random digits.
      I went to the event as a science journalist, to cover what I
      assumed would be the Super Bowl of savants. But when I talked
      to the competitors, they told me something really
      interesting. They weren't savants. And they didn't have
      photographic memories. Rather, they'd trained their memories
      using ancient techniques. They said anyone could do it. I was
      skeptical. Frankly, I didn't believe them. I said, well, if
      anyone can do it, could you teach me? A guy named Ed Cooke,
      who has one of the best trained memories in the world, took
      me under his wing and taught me everything he knew about
      memory techniques. A year later I came back to the contest,
      this time to try and compete, as a sort of exercise in
      participatory journalism. I was curious simply to see how
      well I'd do, but I ended up winning the contest. That really
      wasn't supposed to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong>
        What was the most surprising thing you
      found out about yourself competing in the Memory
      Championships?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong>
        In the process of studying these
      techniques, I learned something remarkable: that there's far
      more potential in our minds than we often give them credit
      for. I'm not just talking about the fact that it's possible
      to memorize lots of information using memory techniques. I'm
      talking about a lesson that is more general, and in a way
      much bigger: that it's possible, with training and hard work,
      to teach oneself to do something that might seem really
      difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong>
        Can you explain the "OK Plateau?"
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong>
        The OK Plateau is that place we all get
      to where we just stop getting better at something. Take
      typing, for example. You might type and type and type all day
      long, but once you reach a certain level, you just never get
      appreciably faster at it. That's because it's become
      automatic. You've moved it to the back of your mind's filing
      cabinet. If you want to become a faster typer, it's possible,
      of course. But you've got to bring the task back under your
      conscious control. You've got to push yourself past where
      you're comfortable. You have to watch yourself fail and learn
      from your mistakes. That's the way to get better at anything.
      And it's how I improved my memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong>
        What do you mean by saying there an "art"
      to memory?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong>
        The "art of memory" refers to a set of
      techniques that were invented in ancient Greece. These are
      the same techniques that Cicero used to memorize his
      speeches, and that medieval scholars used to memorize entire
      books. The "art" is in creating imagery in your mind that is
      so unusual, so colorful, so unlike anything you've ever seen
      before that it's unlikely to be forgotten. That's why
      mnemonists like to say that their skills are as much about
      creativity as memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong>
        How do you think technology has affected
      how and what we remember?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong>
        Once upon a time people invested in their
      memories, they cultivated them. They studiously furnished
      their minds. They remembered. Today, of course, we've got
      books, and computers and smart phones to hold our memories
      for us. We've outsourced our memories to external devices.
      The result is that we no longer trust our memories. We see
      every small forgotten thing as evidence that they're failing
      us altogether. We've forgotten how to remember.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong>
        What is the connection between memory and
      our sense of time?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong>
        As we get older, life seems to fly by
      faster and faster. That's because we structure our experience
      of time around memories. We remember events in relation to
      other events. But as we get older, and our experiences become
      less unique, our memories can blend together. If yesterday's
      lunch is indistinguishable from the one you ate the day
      before, it'll end up being forgotten. That's why it's so hard
      to remember meals. In the same way, if you're not doing
      things that are unique and different and memorable, this year
      can come to resemble the last, and end up being just as
      forgettable as yesterday's lunch. That's why it's so
      important to pack your life with interesting experiences that
      make your life memorable, and provide a texture to the
      passage of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong>
        How is your memory now?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong>
        Ironically, not much better than when I
      started this whole journey. The techniques I learned, and
      used in the memory contest, are great for remembering
      structured information like shopping lists or phone numbers,
      but they don't improve any sort of underlying, generalizable
      memory ability. Unfortunately, I still misplace my car
      keys.

      <h3>From</h3>
      <p>If you sometimes can�t remember where you put your
      car keys or, like Foer, the car itself, don�t panic.
      You�re not alone, and you can do something about it.
      In this intriguing look at the nature of memory, Foer
      reassures us that we don�t need to acquire a better
      memory; we just need to use the one we have more effectively.
      Foer introduces us to people whose memories are both
      astonishing, like the man who could memorize 1,528 random
      digits in order, and frightening, such as a man with such an
      extreme case of amnesia that he doesn�t know his own
      age and can�t remember that he has a memory problem.
      He explores various ways in which we test our memories, such
      as the extensive training British cabbies must undergo. He
      also discusses ways we can train ourselves to have better
      memories, like the PAO system, in which, for example, every
      card in a deck is associated with an image of a specific
      person, action, or object. An engaging, informative, and for
      the forgetful, encouraging book. --David Pitt</p>
