      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">Since Darwin's day, we've been told that sexual monogamy
    comes naturally to our species. Mainstream science—as
    well as religious and cultural institutions—has
    maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a
    man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's
    fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer
    and fewer couples are getting married, and divorce rates keep
    climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even
    seemingly solid marriages.</p>
    <p xmlns="">How can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative?
    It can't be, according to renegade thinkers Christopher Ryan
    and Cacilda Jethå. While debunking almost everything we
    "know" about sex, they offer a bold alternative explanation in
    this provocative and brilliant book.</p>
    <p xmlns="">Ryan and Jethå's central contention is that human
    beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food, child
    care, and, often, sexual partners. Weaving together convergent,
    frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology, archaeology,
    primatology, anatomy, and psychosexuality, the authors show how
    far from human nature monogamy really is. Human beings
    everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar,
    intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. The authors
    expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing
    toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate
    capacities for love, cooperation, and generosity.</p>
    <p xmlns="">With intelligence, humor, and wonder, Ryan and Jethå
    show how our promiscuous past haunts our struggles over
    monogamy, sexual orientation, and family dynamics. They explore
    why long-term fidelity can be so difficult for so many; why
    sexual passion tends to fade even as love deepens; why many
    middle-aged men risk everything for transient affairs with
    younger women; why homosexuality persists in the face of
    standard evolutionary logic; and what the human body reveals
    about the prehistoric origins of modern sexuality.</p>
    <p xmlns="">
      In the tradition of the best historical and scientific
    writing,
      <em>Sex at Dawn</em>
      unapologetically upends unwarranted
    assumptions and unfounded conclusions while offering a
    revolutionary understanding of why we live and love as we
    do.
    </p>
    <h3 xmlns="">Review</h3>
    <p xmlns="">“You clearly have an exciting book on your hands,
    whether people agree with it or not: these are issues that will
    need debating over and over before we will arrive at a
    resolution.”</p>
    <h3 xmlns="">Review</h3>
    <p xmlns="">"Funny, witty, and light ... Sex at Dawn is a scandal in the
    best sense, one that will have you reading the best parts aloud
    and reassessing your ideas about humanity's basic urges well
    after the book is done."--Newsweek</p>
