      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">On board the whaling ship Pequod, a crew of wise men and
  fools, renegades, and seeming phantoms is hurled through
  treacherous seas by a crazed captain hell-bent on hunting down
  the mythic White Whale. As the "great flood-gates of the
  wonder-world" swing open, Melville transforms the little world of
  the whale-ship into a crucible where mankind's fears, faith and
  frailties are pitted against a relentless fate. Teeming with
  ideas and imagery, and with its extraordinary, compressed
  intensity sustained by a buoyant, mischievous irony and by
  moments of exquisite beauty, Melville's masterpiece is both a
  great American epic and one of the most profoundly imaginative
  creations in literary history. Herman Melville was born in 1819
  in New York City. Both his grandfathers were Revolutionary War
  heroes but his father, a merchant, died bankrupt in 1833.
  Melville left school and worked at various jobs before shipping
  on the whaler Acushnet in 1841. The next year he deserted,
  traveled the South Seas and joined the US Navy. After three years
  he retired, settled in Massachusetts and started to write. His
  first two novels, Typee (1846) and Omoo (1847), were
  fictionalized accounts of his travels: they remained his most
  popular works during his lifetime. In 1847 Melville married and
  wrote a series of novels he considered potboilers for money. With
  Moby-Dick (1851) he changed course, partly under the influence of
  Nathaniel Hawthorne; but the novel's extravagant intensity lost
  him readers. Pierre (1852) fared no better, and after publishing
  one more novel Melville took a job as a customs inspector in the
  New York City harbor and turned to writing poetry. He died there
  in 1891; an unfinished novel, Billy Budd, Sailor, was published
  in 1924.</p>

      Grade 5 Up-Opening with the classic line, "Call me Ishmael,"
  the narrator's New England accent adds a touch of authenticity to
  this sometimes melodramatic presentation. The St. Charles Players
  do a credible job on the major roles, but some of the group
  responses, such as "Aye, aye Captain," sound more comic than
  serious. This adaptation retains a good measure of Melville's
  dialogue and key passages which afford listeners a vivid
  connection with the lengthy novel. Background music and
  appropriate sound effects enhance the telling of the story about
  Captain Ahab's obsessive pursuit of the malevolent white whale.
  The cassettes are clearly marked, and running times are noted on
  each side of the tapes. Announcements at the beginning of each
  side and a subtle chime signal at the end make it easy to follow
  the story, but a stereo player must be used to hear some
  dialogue. The lightweight cardboard package is inadequate for
  circulation. Done in a radio theatre format, the recording does a
  nice job of introducing the deeper themes of the book and
  covering the major events. For school libraries that support an
  American literature curriculum, this recording offers a different
  interpretation of an enduring classic.

      In a sense, this work is the piece de resistance of the
  textual revolution in American scholarship of the past
  generation. The first half is the final MLA "Approved Text" of
  the classic novel, prepared under the auspices of the Center for
  Editions of American Authors. The second half consists of an
  Historical Note detailing background, genetic composition,
  publication, and ensuing critical reception; a discussion of its
  textual history; and some relevant marginalia. The work is not
  only thorough and rigorous, but, considering the scholarly
  grittiness of the endeavor, surprisingly lucid and graceful in
  its exposition. Highly recommended for special collections. Earl
