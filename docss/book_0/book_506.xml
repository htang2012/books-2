      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">4GW (Fourth Generation Warfare) is the only kind of war
    America has ever lost. And we have done so three times –
    in Vietnam, Lebanon, and Somalia. This form of warfare has also
    defeated the French in Vietnam and Algeria, and the USSR in
    Afghanistan...As the only Goliath left in the world, we should
    be worried that the world's Davids have found a sling and stone
    that work." – Chapter 1, The Sling and the Stone: On War
    in the 21st Century. The War in Iraq. The War on Terror. These
    types of "asymmetrical" warfare are the conflicts of the 21st
    century – and show how difficult it is for the world's
    remaining superpower to battle insurgents and terrorists who
    will fight unconventionally in the face of superior military
    power. This change in military conflict may seem sudden.</p>
