      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>
        <strong>A special edition hardcover in celebration of Ayn
        Rand's centennial.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When it was first published in 1943,
        <em>The Fountainhead</em>
        --containing Ayn Rand's daringly
      original literary vision with the seeds of her groundbreaking
      philosophy, Objectivismwon immediate worldwide acclaim.
      This instant classic is the story of an intransigent young
      architect, his violent battle against conventional standards,
      and his explosive love affair with a beautiful woman who
      struggles to defeat him. This centennial edition of
        <em>The Fountainhead</em>
        , celebrating the controversial and
      eduring legacy of its author, features an afterword by Rand's
      literary executor, Leonard Peikoff, offering some of Ayn
      Rand's personal notes on the development of her
      masterwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        “A writer of great power. She has a subtle and
      ingenious mind and the capacity of writing brilliantly,
      beautifully, bitterly.”
        <br />
        --
        <em>The New York Times</em>

      <h4>Annotation</h4>
      <p>A phenomenal bestseller since its publication in 1943, The
      Fountainhead brought Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism to
      a worldwide audience. As original today as it was when it was
      written, this novel reinvents the modern-day hero. This
      anniversary edition includes a special afterword by Leonard
      Peikoff and excerpts from Rand's own notes about the
      book.</p>
