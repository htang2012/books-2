      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">EDITORIAL REVIEW: Marriage should be based on love, right?
    But does it seem as though you and your spouse are speaking two
    different languages? *New York Times* bestselling author Dr.
    Gary Chapman guides couples in identifying, understanding, and
    speaking their spouse’s primary love
    language—quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts
    of service, or physical touch. By learning the five love
    languages, you and your spouse will discover your unique love
    languages and learn practical steps in truly loving each other.
    Chapters are categorized by love language for easy reference,
    and each one ends with specific, simple steps to express a
    specific language to your spouse and guide your marriage in the
    right direction. A newly designed love languages assessment
    will help you understand and strengthen your relationship. You
    can build a lasting, loving marriage together. Gary Chapman
    hosts a nationally syndicated daily radio program called *A
    Love Language Minute* that can be heard on more than 150 radio
    stations as well as the weekly syndicated program *Building
    Relationships with Gary Chapman*, which can both be heard on
    fivelovelanguages.com. *The Five Love Languages* is a
    consistent new York Times bestseller - with over **5 million
    copies** sold and translated into 38 languages. This book is a
    sales phenomenon, with each year outselling the prior for 16
    years running! Includes a promotional code to gain exclusive
    online access to the new comprehensive love languages
    assessment.</p>
