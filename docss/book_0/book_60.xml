      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="" class="description">"Using the same DNA fingerprinting
    technology used in the courtroom, biologists have now been able
    to trace parenthood in animals for the first time with
    certainty. The results have been astonishing: Even among those
    species previously thought to be monogamous, cheating on your
    mate is common--for both sexes. In The Myth of Monogamy, David
    Barash and Judith Eve Lipton describe how this new research
    shows that there is simply no question whether sexual desire
    for multiple partners is 'natural.' It is. Similarly, there is
    no question of monogamy being 'natural.' It isn't. Armed with
    this evidence, scientists have also been able to explain such
    important questions as why animals (including humans) cheat,
    why the myth of monogamy was created in the first place, how
    men and women were sucked into the monogamy hoax, who stands to
    gain the most by perpetuating the myth of monogamy, and how big
    of a role procreation plays in the desire to have several sex
    partners. Finally, The Myth of Monogamy explores the
    implications of these dramatic new findings for humans, in
    terms of relationships, parenting, aggression, and
    more"--Publisher description.</p>
