      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      Walden Two is a utopian novel by behavioral psychologist
    B.F. Skinner. It describes a 1000 person planned rural
    community in which the members are happy &amp; productively
    creative. The community is governed by Managers, six Planners
    &amp; supports a few Scientists. It promotes arts &amp;
    leisure, requiring only four hours of work per member daily.
    Members subscribe to a Code of conduct which is based on, &amp;
    supported by, a science of human behavior resembling Skinner's
    own conception of human behavior.
      <br />
      Walden Two challenges a host of social conventions
    including the value of modern education, the effectiveness of
    professors &amp; the problems of excessive work. It argues for
    a planned economy against Capitalism. The governing structure
    isn't democratic in a conventional sense. Children are raised
    largely outside of the nuclear family &amp; are encouraged to
    be loyal to the community over their parents. Members are
    encouraged to have children &amp; the community pursues a high
    growth policy. The book alludes to the acquisition of political
    power &amp; to an expansive strategy of replication. It flirts
    with eugenics, suggesting the creation of a Golden Age.
      <br />
      Walden Two controversies include the rejection of
    democracy, the perceived narrow range of emotional expression,
    its possible appeal to dictators, the attraction to it by
    people who seek to emulate T.E. Frazier, the emotionally
    unstable protagonist, the socialistic nature of the economic
    system &amp; its essentially atheistic bent.
      <br />
      Walden Two is a novel about a small party of visitors to
    the community ten years after its founding. T.E. Frazier in
    founding the community had written a popular article suggesting
    people join him in starting a community based on Thoreau's
    ideas a decade earlier.
      <br />
      Two soldiers, returning from the war, are trying to find
    Frazier, enlisting the help of Prof. Burris. Burris finds
    Frazier, contacts him, &amp; finds himself swept up into a
    small party of visitors to the community.
      <br />
      Burris invites a fellow professor, Augustine Castle,
    &amp; with the two original veterans, Rogers &amp; Steve
    Jamnick, &amp; their partners--Mary Grove &amp; Barbara
    Macklin--six head out.
      <br />
      The story has many plot devices, but centers on
    arguments between Frazier &amp; his foil Castle, with some
    small diversions provided by Burris. This is done to allow us
    to hear about the various reasons for the community's
    structure, its past &amp; its future. The novel ends with one
    couple staying, the rest of the party leaving. Burris, in a
    sudden change of heart, turns around &amp; comes back, quitting
    his job at the university without notice.
