      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="" class="description">Political polarization in America is at
    an all-time high, and the conflict has moved beyond
    disagreements about matters of policy. For the first time in
    more than twenty years, research has shown that members of both
    parties hold strongly unfavorable views of their opponents.
    This is polarization rooted in social identity, and it is
    growing. The campaign and election of Donald Trump laid bare
    this fact of the American electorate, its successful rhetoric
    of “us versus them” tapping into a powerful current
    of anger and resentment. With Uncivil Agreement, Lilliana Mason
    looks at the growing social gulf across racial, religious, and
    cultural lines, which have recently come to divide neatly
    between the two major political parties. She argues that group
    identifications have changed the way we think and feel about
    ourselves and our opponents. Even when Democrats and
    Republicans can agree on policy outcomes, they tend to view one
    other with distrust and to work for party victory over all
    else. Although the polarizing effects of social divisions have
    simplified our electoral choices and increased political
    engagement, they have not been a force that is, on balance,
    helpful for American democracy. Bringing together theory from
    political science and social psychology, Uncivil Agreement
    clearly describes this increasingly “social” type
    of polarization in American politics and will add much to our
    understanding of contemporary politics.</p>
