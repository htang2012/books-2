        Khaled Hosseini, the #1
        <em>New York Times</em>
        –bestselling author of
        <em>The Kite Runner</em>
        and
        <em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em>
        , has written a new novel
      about how we love, how we take care of one another, and how
      the choices we make resonate through generations. In this
      tale revolving around not just parents and children but
      brothers and sisters, cousins and caretakers, Hosseini
      explores the many ways in which families nurture, wound,
      betray, honor, and sacrifice for one another; and how often
      we are surprised by the actions of those closest to us, at
      the times that matter most. Following its characters and the
      ramifications of their lives and choices and loves around the
      globe—from Kabul to Paris to San Francisco to the Greek
      island of Tinos—the story expands gradually outward,
      becoming more emotionally complex and powerful with each
      turning page.

      <h3>Amazon.com Review</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2013:</strong>
        Khaled Hosseini’s
        <em>And the Mountains Echoed</em>
        begins simply enough, with
      a father recounting a folktale to his two young children. The
      tale is about a young boy who is taken by a
        <em>div</em>
        (a sort of ogre), and how that fate might not be
      as terrible as it first seems—a brilliant device that
      firmly sets the tone for the rest of this sweeping,
      heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting novel. A day after he
      tells the tale of the
        <em>div</em>
        , the father gives away his own daughter to a
      wealthy man in Kabul. What follows is a series of stories
      within the story, told through multiple viewpoints, spanning
      more than half a century, and shifting across continents. The
      novel moves through war, separation, birth, death, deceit,
      and love, illustrating again and again how people’s
      actions, even the seemingly selfless ones, are shrouded in
      ambiguity. This is a masterwork by a master storyteller.

      <h3>Review</h3>
      <p>
        “
        <em>And the Mountains Echo</em>
        ed opens like a thunderclap. .
      . . [Hosseini] asks good, hard questions about the limits of
      love. . . . Love, Hosseini seems to say, is the great
      leveler, cutting through language, class, and identity. 
      No one in this gripping novel is immune to its
      impact.”—
        <em>O, the Oprah Magazine</em>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “With his third and most ambitious novel yet,
      Hosseini makes it clear that he's not ready to rest on his
      Big Name. . . . While it hits all the Hosseini sweet
      spots—nostalgia, devastating details, triumph over the
      odds—
        <em>And the Mountains Echoed</em>
        covers more ground, both
      geographically and emotionally, than his previous works. It's
      not until Hosseini makes the novel small again, for the
      poignant conclusion, that you fully appreciate what he's
      accomplished.”—
        <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>
        (A)
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Transports you whole into the otherworldly realms
      Hosseini builds in Kabul, Paris, San Francisco, and the Greek
      islands. . . . There's something primary and beautiful about
      the simple desire to get lost in a story, and Hosseini is an
      expert manufacturer of that experience.”—
        <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Like a sculptor working in a soft medium,
      [Hosseini] gently molds and shapes individual pieces that
      ultimately fit together in a major work. . . . Family matters
      in ways small and large in this novel. Whether or not the
      connections are visible, they exist nevertheless. Hosseini
      seems to be telling us that the way we care is who we are
      and, ultimately, the face we show to life.”—
        <em>New York Daily News</em>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        "Readers' tears may fall by first chapter's end . . .
      Introspective and perfectly paced, Hosseini's microcosmic
      plot spares no expense with sensory details. Each character .
      . . captivates. Hosseini skillfully weaves the tapestry with
      universal elements: human fallibility, innate goodness,
      perseverance, forgiveness, sexuality, jealousy,
      companionship, and joy. Yet his words are never sugarcoated:
      The brutality of life is on display, and people are shown
      just as they are, for better or worse. Poverty and gender
      roles leave scars, while shifting points of view reveal
      Hosseini's prism of truth. The heartbreaks are not intended
      for shock value, but they do linger. And the Mountains Echoed
      resonates to the core.”—
        <em>Austin Chronicle</em>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Like [Hosseini’s] previous books, the new
      novel is a complex mosaic, a portrait of the Afghan diaspora
      as it is folded into the West and of those left behind. . . .
      The book is elevated by a strong sense of parable and some
      finely drawn characters and is inventively constructed as it
      leaps from voice to voice.”—
        <em>Esquire</em>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Devoted readers will find it worth the
      wait.”—
        <em>Patriot Ledger</em>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hosseini returns with an instantly relatable novel
      that follows generations of a troubled family across the
      Middle East.”—
        <em>Marie Claire</em>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “The beautiful writing, full of universal truths of
      loss and identity, makes each section a jewel . . .
      Hosseini’s eye for detail and emotional geography makes
      this a haunting read.”—
        <em>Publishers Weekly</em>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Captivating and affecting . . . A masterful and
      compassionate storyteller, Hosseini traces the traumas and
      scarring of tyranny, war, crime, lies, and illness in the
      intricately interconnected, heartbreaking, and transcendent
      lives of his vibrantly realized characters to create a grand
      and encompassing tree of life.”—
        <em>Booklist</em>
        (starred review)
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Hosseini weaves a gorgeous tapestry of disparate
      characters joined by threads of blood and fate. . . . In this
      uplifting and deeply satisfying book, Hosseini displays an
      optimism not so obvious in his previous works. Readers will
      be clamoring for it.”—
        <em>Library Journal</em>
        (starred review)
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “In
        <em>And the Mountains Echoed</em>
        , Khaled Hosseini presents a
      multitude of windows into the souls affected by these events.
      The novel's rich kaleidoscope of images coalesces around one
      theme: the powerful and often excruciating legacy of family
      ties within the maelstrom of history.”—
        <em>Shelf Awareness</em>
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Fiction Top Pick . . . Engrossing . . . Ultimately,
        <em>And the Mountains Echoed</em>
        is about the human endeavor
      to transcend difference.”—
        <em>Bookpage</em>
        <br />
