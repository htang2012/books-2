      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">Why are people around the world so very different? What
    makes us live, buy, even love as we do? The answers are in the
    codes.</p>
    <p xmlns="">
      In
      <em>The Culture Code</em>
      , internationally revered cultural
    anthropologist and marketing expert Clotaire Rapaille reveals
    for the first time the techniques he has used to improve
    profitability and practices for dozens of Fortune 100
    companies. His groundbreaking revelations shed light not just
    on business but on the way every human being acts and lives
    around the world.
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">Rapaille’s breakthrough notion is that we acquire a
    silent system of codes as we grow up within our culture. These
    codes—the Culture Code—are what make us American,
    or German, or French, and they invisibly shape how we behave in
    our personal lives, even when we are completely unaware of our
    motives. What’s more, we can learn to crack the codes
    that guide our actions and achieve new understanding of why we
    do the things we do.</p>
    <p xmlns="">
      Rapaille has used the Culture Code to help Chrysler build
    the PT Cruiser—the most successful American car launch in
    recent memory. He has used it to help Procter &amp; Gamble
    design its advertising campaign for Folger’s coffee
    – one of the longest lasting and most successful
    campaigns in the annals of advertising. He has used it to help
    companies as diverse as GE, AT&amp;T, Boeing, Honda, Kellogg,
    and L’Oréal improve their bottom line at home and
    overseas. And now, in
      <em>The Culture Code</em>
      , he uses it to reveal why Americans
    act distinctly like Americans, and what makes us different from
    the world around us.
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      In
      <em>The Culture Code</em>
      , Dr. Rapaille decodes two dozen of
    our most fundamental archetypes—ranging from sex to money
    to health to America itself—to give us “a new set
    of glasses” with which to view our actions and
    motivations. Why are we so often disillusioned by love? Why is
    fat a solution rather than a problem? Why do we reject the
    notion of perfection? Why is fast food in our lives to stay?
    The answers are in the Codes.
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      Understanding the Codes gives us unprecedented freedom over
    our lives. It lets us do business in dramatically new ways. And
    it finally explains why people around the world really
      <em>are</em>
      different, and reveals the hidden clues to
    understanding us all.
