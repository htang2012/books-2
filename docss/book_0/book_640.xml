      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p class="description">Have you ever . . . Invested time in
      something that, in hindsight, just wasn't worth it? Paid too
      much in an eBay auction? Continued to do something you knew
      was bad for you? Sold stocks too late, or too early? Taken
      credit for success, but blamed failure on external
      circumstances? Backed the wrong horse?</p>
      <p class="description">These are examples of what the author
      calls cognitive biases, simple errors all of us make in
      day-to-day thinking. But by knowing what they are and how to
      identify them, we can avoid them and make better choices:
      whether in dealing with personal problems or business
      negotiations, trying to save money or earn profits, or merely
      working out what we really want in life—and
      strategizing the best way to get it.</p>
      <p class="description">
        Already an international bestseller,
        <b>The Art of Thinking Clearly</b>
        distills cutting-edge
      research from behavioral economics, psychology, and
      neuroscience into a clever, practical guide for anyone who's
      ever wanted to be wiser and make better decisions. A
      novelist, thinker, and entrepreneur, Rolf Dobelli deftly
      shows that in order to lead happier, more prosperous lives,
      we don't need extra cunning, new ideas, shiny gadgets, or
      more frantic hyperactivity—all we need is less
      irrationality.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Simple, clear, and always surprising,
      this indispensable book will change the way you think and
      transform your decision making—at work, at home, every
      day. From why you shouldn't accept a free drink to why you
      should walk out of a movie you don't like, from why it's so
      hard to predict the future to why you shouldn't watch the
      news,
        <b>The Art of Thinking Clearly</b>
        helps solve the puzzle of
      human reasoning.
