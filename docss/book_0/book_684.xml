      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      The old saying goes, ''To the man with a hammer, everything
    looks like a nail.'' But anyone who has done any kind of
    project knows a hammer often isn't enough. The more tools you
    have at your disposal, the more likely you'll use the right
    tool for the job -- and get it done right. The same is true
    when it comes to your thinking. The quality of your outcomes
    depends on the mental models in your head. And most people are
    going through life with little more than a hammer. Until now.
      <em>The Great Mental Models: General Thinking Concepts</em>
      is
    the first book in The Great Mental Models series designed to
    upgrade your thinking with the best, most useful and powerful
    tools so you always have the right one on hand. This volume
    details nine of the most versatile, all-purpose mental models
    you can use right away to improve your decision making,
    productivity, and how clearly you see the world. You will
    discover what forces govern the universe and how to focus your
    efforts so you can harness them to your advantage, rather than
    fight with them or worse yet-- ignore them. Upgrade your mental
    toolbox and get the first volume today. **
