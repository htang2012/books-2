      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="" class="description">When The Unbearable Lightness of Being
    was first published in English, it was hailed as "a work of the
    boldest mastery, originality, and richness" by critic Elizabeth
    Hardwick and named one of the best books of 1984 by the New
    York Times Book Review. It went on to win the Los Angeles Times
    Book Prize for Fiction and quickly became an international
    bestseller. Twenty years later, the novel has established
    itself as a modern classic. To commemorate the anniversary of
    its first English-language publication, HarperCollins is proud
    to offer a special hardcover edition. A young woman in love
    with a man torn between his love for her and his incorrigible
    womanizing; one of his mistresses and her humbly faithful lover
    -- these are the two couples whose story is told in this
    masterful novel. Controlled by day, Tereza's jealousy awakens
    by night, transformed into ineffably sad death-dreams, while
    Tomas, a successful surgeon, alternates loving devotion to the
    dependent Tereza with the ardent pursuit of other women.
    Sabina, an independent, free-spirited artist, lives her life as
    a series of betrayals -- of parents, husband, country, love
    itself -- whereas her lover, the intellectual Franz, loses all
    because of his earnest goodness and fidelity. In a world in
    which lives are shaped by irrevocable choices and by fortuitous
    events, a world in which everything occurs but once, existence
    seems to lose its substance, its weight. Hence we feel, says
    the novelist, "the unbearable lightness of being" -- not only
    as the consequence of our private acts but also in the public
    sphere, and the two inevitably intertwine. This magnificent
    novel encompasses the extremes of comedy and tragedy, and
    embraces, it seems, all aspects of human existence. It
    juxtaposes geographically distant places (Prague, Geneva,
    Paris, Thailand, the United States, a forlorn Bohemian
    village); brilliant and playful reflections (on "eternal
    return," on kitsch, on man and animals -- Tomas and Tereza have
    a beloved doe named Karenin); and a variety of styles (from the
    farcical to the elegiac) to take its place as perhaps the major
    achievement of one of the world's truly great writers.</p>
