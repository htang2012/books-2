      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <div xmlns="">
      <p>Originally published in 1985, Neil Postman’s
      groundbreaking polemic about the corrosive effects of
      television on our politics and public discourse has been
      hailed as a twenty-first-century book published in the
      twentieth century. </p>
      <p>Now, with television joined by more sophisticated
      electronic media—from the Internet to cell phones to
      DVDs—it has taken on even greater significance.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Amusing Ourselves to Death</strong>
        is a prophetic
      look at what happens when politics, journalism, education,
      and even religion become subject to the demands of 
      entertainment. It is also a blueprint for regaining controlof
      our media, so that they can serve our highest goals.
