      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">Since its original landmark publication in 1980, A People's
    History of the United States has been chronicling American
    history from the bottom up, throwing out the official version
    of history taught in schools–with its emphasis on great
    men in high places–to focus on the street, the home, and
    the workplace.Known for its lively, clear prose as well as its
    scholarly research, A People's History is the only volume to
    tell America's story from the point of view of–and in the
    words of–America's women, factory workers, African
    Americans, Native Americans, working poor, and immigrant
    laborers. As historian Howard Zinn shows, many of our country's
    greatest battles–for a fair wage, an eight-hour workday,
    child-labor laws, health and safety standards, universal
    suffrage, women's rights, racial equality–were carried
    out at the grassroots level, against bloody resistance.
    Covering Christopher Columbus's arrival through the 2000
    Election and the "war on terrorism," A People's History of the
    United States, which was nominated for the American Book Award
    in 1981 and has sold more than one million copies, features
    insightful analysis of the most important events in our
    history.This new edition contains two new chapters covering the
    Clinton presidency, the 2000 Election, and the "war on
    terrorism," continuing Zinn's important contribution to a
    complete and balanced understanding of American history.</p>
