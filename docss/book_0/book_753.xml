      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">EDITORIAL REVIEW:</p>
    <br xmlns="" />
    <br xmlns="" />
    <p xmlns="">'Brilliant and terrifying' - "Observer". I had to be the man
    who was doing well and more than well, the man whose drab shop
    concealed some bigger operation that made millions. I had to be
    the man who had planned it all, who had come to the destroyed
    town at the bend in the river because he had foreseen the rich
    future. 'Salim, the narrator, is a young man from an Indian
    family of traders long resident on the coast of Centeral
    Africa. Salim has left the coast to make his way in the
    interior, there to take on a small trading shop of this and
    that, sudries, sold to the natives. The place is 'a bend in the
    river'; it is Africa. The time is post-colonial, the time of
    Independence. The Europeans have withdrawn or been forced to
    withdraw and the scene is one of chaos, violent change, warring
    tribes, ignorance, isolation, poverty and a lack of prepartion
    for the modern world they have entered, or partially assumed as
    a sort of decoration. It is a story of historical upheaval and
    social breakdown. Naipaul has fashioned a work of intense
    imaginative force. It is a haunting creation, rich with
    incident and human bafflement, played out in an immense detail
    of landscape rendered with a poignant brilliance' - Elizabeth
    Hardwick. 'Always a master of fictional landscape, Naipaul here
    shows, in his variety of human examples and in his search for
    underlying social causes, a Tolstoyan spirit' - John
    Updike.</p>
