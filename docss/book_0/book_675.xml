    <p xmlns="">Thinner, bigger, faster, stronger... which 150 pages will
    you read? Is it possible to: Reach your genetic potential in 6
    months? Sleep 2 hours per day and perform better than on 8
    hours? Lose more fat than a marathoner by bingeing? Indeed, and
    much more. This is not just another diet and fitness book. The
    4-Hour Body is the result of an obsessive quest, spanning more
    than a decade, to hack the human body. It contains the
    collective wisdom of hundreds of elite athletes, dozens of MDs,
    and thousands of hours of jaw-dropping personal
    experimentation. From Olympic training centers to black-market
    laboratories, from Silicon Valley to South Africa, Tim Ferriss,
    the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The 4-Hour
    Workweek, fixated on one life-changing question: For all things
    physical, what are the tiniest changes that produce the biggest
    results? Thousands of tests later, this book contains the
    answers for both men and women. From the gym to the bedroom,
    it’s all here, and it all works. YOU WILL LEARN (in less
    than 30 minutes each): How to lose those last 5-10 pounds (or
    100+ pounds) with odd combinations of food and safe chemical
    cocktails. * How to prevent fat gain while bingeing (X-mas,
    holidays, weekends) * How to increase fat-loss 300% with a few
    bags of ice * How Tim gained 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days,
    without steroids, and in four hours of total gym time * How to
    sleep 2 hours per day and feel fully rested * How to produce
    15-minute female orgasms * How to triple testosterone and
    double sperm count* How to go from running 5 kilometers to 50
    kilometers in 12 weeks * How to reverse “permanent”
    injuries * How to add 150+ pounds to your lifts in 6 months *
    How to pay for a beach vacation with one hospital visit And
    that's just the tip of the iceberg. There are more than 50
    topics covered, all with real-world experiments, many including
    more than 200 test subjects. You don't need better genetics or
    more discipline. You need immediate results that compel you to
    continue. That’s exactly what The 4-Hour Body
    delivers.From the Hardcover edition.</p>
