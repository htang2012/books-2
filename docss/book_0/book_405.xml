      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="" class="description">Cicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE),
    Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, of whom we
    know more than of any other Roman, lived through the stirring
    era which saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius
    Caesar in a tottering republic. In his political speeches
    especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement,
    tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the
    turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, delivered before
    the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before
    jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In
    the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists
    discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of
    which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by
    others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the
    more striking because most were not written for publication.
    Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments.
    Philosophical works include seven extant major compositions and
    a number of others; and some lost. There is also poetry, some
    original, some as translations from the Greek. The Loeb
    Classical Library edition of Cicero is in twenty-nine
    volumes.</p>
