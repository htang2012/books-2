      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">Heralded by the New York Times and Time magazine as the
    couple therapy with the highest rate of success, Emotionally
    Focused Therapy works because it views the love relationship as
    an attachment bond. This idea, once controversial, is now
    supported by science, and has become widely popular among
    therapists around the world. In HOLD ME TIGHT, Dr. Sue Johnson
    presents Emotionally Focused Therapy to the general public for
    the first time. Johnson teaches that the way to save and enrich
    a relationship is to reestablish safe emotional connection and
    preserve the attachment bond. With this in mind, she focuses on
    key moments in a relationship-from Recognizing the Demon
    Dialogue to Revisiting a Rocky Moment-and uses them as
    touchpoints for seven healing conversations. Through case
    studies from her practice, illuminating advice, and practical
    exercises, couples will learn how to nurture their
    relationships and ensure a lifetime of love.</p>
