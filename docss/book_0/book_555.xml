    <p xmlns="">EDITORIAL REVIEW:</p>

    <p xmlns="">The #1 New York Times bestseller: a brilliant
    account—character-rich and darkly humorous—of how
    the U.S. economy was driven over the cliff. When the crash of
    the U. S. stock market became public knowledge in the fall of
    2008, it was already old news. The real crash, the silent
    crash, had taken place over the previous year, in bizarre
    feeder markets where the sun doesn’t shine, and the SEC
    doesn’t dare, or bother, to tread: the bond and real
    estate derivative markets where geeks invent impenetrable
    securities to profit from the misery of lower- and middle-class
    Americans who can’t pay their debts. The smart people who
    understood what was or might be happening were paralyzed by
    hope and fear; in any case, they weren’t talking. The
    crucial question is this: Who understood the risk inherent in
    the assumption of ever-rising real estate prices, a risk
    compounded daily by the creation of those arcane, artificial
    securities loosely based on piles of doubtful mortgages?
    Michael Lewis turns the inquiry on its head to create a fresh,
    character-driven narrative brimming with indignation and dark
    humor, a fitting sequel to his #1 best-selling Liar’s
    Poker. Who got it right? he asks. Who saw the real estate
    market for the black hole it would become, and eventually made
    billions of dollars from that perception? And what qualities of
    character made those few persist when their peers and
    colleagues dismissed them as Chicken Littles? Out of this
    handful of unlikely—really unlikely—heroes, Lewis
    fashions a story as compelling and unusual as any of his
    earlier bestsellers, proving yet again that he is the finest
    and funniest chronicler of our times.</p>
