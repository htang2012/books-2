      <strong>Summary</strong>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">Under Andy Grove's leadership, Intel has become the world's
    largest chipmaker, the fifth-most-admired company in America,
    and the seventh-most-profitable company among the Fortune 500.
    You don't achieve rankings like these unless you have mastered
    a rare understanding of the art of business and an unusual way
    with its practice.Few CEOs can claim this level of consistent
    record-breaking success. Grove attributes much of this success
    to the philosophy and strategy he reveals in Only the Paranoid
    Survive--a book that is unique in leadership annals for
    offering a bold new business measure, and for taking the reader
    deep inside the workings of a major corporation. Grove's
    contribution to business thinking concerns a new way of
    measuring the nightmare moment every leader dreads--the moment
    when massive change occurs and all bets are off. The success
    you had the day before is gone, destroyed by unforeseen changes
    that hit like a stage-six rapid. Grove calls such moments
    Strategic Inflection Points, and he has lived through several.
    When SlPs hit, all rules of business shift fast, furiously, and
    forever. SlPs can be set off by almost
    anything--megacompetition, an arcane change in regulations, or
    a seemingly modest change in technology.Yet in the watchful
    leader's hand, SlPs can be an ace. Managed right, a company can
    turn a SIP into a positive force to win in the marketplace and
    emerge stronger than ever.To achieve that level of mastery over
    change, you must know its properties inside and out. Grove
    addresses questions such as these: What are the stages of these
    tidal waves? What sources do you turn to in order to foresee
    dangers before trouble announces itself? When threats abound,
    how do you deal with your emotions, your calendar, your
    career--as well as with your most loyal managers and customers,
    who may cling to tradition?No stranger to risk, Grove examines
    his own record of success and failure, including the drama of
    how he navigated the events of the Pentium flaw, which
    threatened Intel in a major way, and how he is dealing with the
    SIP brought on by the Internet. The work of a lifetime of
    reflection, Only the Paranoid Survive is a contemporary classic
    of leadership skills.</p>
